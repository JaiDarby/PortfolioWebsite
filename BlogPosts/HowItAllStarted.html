                Believe it or not, Computer Science was the last thing I saw myself majoring in when I was a kid. I always thought that I would go into social sciences even though I was not entirely sure which one. 
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                The Debater
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                I was very much still am very into politics, oftentimes finding myself in debate servers trying to explain my points of view and expand it as well. Given this, at first, it made the most sense to me to major in Political Science and hopefully become a mayor, governor, or even a lawyer. The idea of being able to make changes that impact multiple people for the better was awesome to me but then looking into it, it became more and more clear that maybe it wasnt for me. 
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                While yes, debating and things of the sort were something that I felt passionate about, the amount of reading and paperwork did not sound as entertaining. As a result, I scrapped the idea and moved forward to something else.
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                The Therapist
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                In middle school, I was friends with a lot of people, many of which we're going through a lot whether it is mentally, physically, or socially. Often I’d find myself doing my best to help them overcome these adversities. I enjoyed the feeling of cheering people up so much if even for a moment, feeling like I could impact people’s lives for the better was again my motivating force.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                So, next, I went through most of my middle school years thinking about becoming a therapist of some sort. At first, a Psychiatrist was my goal but upon learning that I had to go to med school to become one I quickly dropped that idea. So after I set my sight on being a Psychologist.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Psychology wasn’t a bad idea at all until I started thinking about the reality of becoming one. Of course, I get to help people but I also realized that I would be the last line of defense for a lot of these people. And the thought of falling short given that and something potentially dangerous happening, as a result, was a weight that I did not think I would be able to bear.
              </p>

                The Programmer
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Now out of the loop of what I was going to do with my life in 8th grade, I stumbled upon Khan Academy’s Coding Program. I was instantly hooked and oftentimes found learning there more than I would learning math like I was supposed to be doing. Not that little Jai’Mir knew at the time but that little bit o Javascript code was enough to get into a CS class in sophomore year and launch me into the programming addict I am today.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                So I guess I could thank my 8th-grade I-Prep teacher for not paying attention enough to what I was doing in class to me finding my career path.
