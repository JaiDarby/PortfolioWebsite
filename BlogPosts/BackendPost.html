              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                When I first started programming I had no idea what that backend and frontend programming was a thing. I simply picked up the programming language that I thought was the most fun and ran with it. The language in question here just so happened to be Python.

                My First Taste
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Well, I guess that technically isn’t entirely where I began, see in middle school, my 8th-grade year I was in I-Prep Algebra which basically meant I was in a class unsupervised every day expected to complete Khan Academy assignments. I of course didn’t think that khan academy math was fun so I would oftentimes find myself programming on Khan Academy instead. At the time I didn’t know nor care what language this was but now I know that I was learning and actually getting pretty decent at JavaScript.
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                High School
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Once I made it to Highschool I wanted to do anything I could to learn more about this “Coding” thing so I of course joined a Computer Science class my sophomore year. My teacher at the time allowed the class to choose out of a list of languages what we wanted to program in and we ended up collectively choosing Python. 
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                This was a very beginning level course mostly just going over things like the difference between an int and a float. With the occasional programming assignment that required no more than a while loop and a couple if statements. Needless to say, this was not enough to pique my interest, it was all too easy and not enough of a challenge.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Being the active learn I am I decided that I was going to join the programming club at my school - which just so happened to be run my the same teacher - in an attempt to learn more. Here I learned much more mostly through actually making programs. I would create games like Pokemon or  Hangman (all text-based) and really ended up solidifying my knowledge of the basic syntax of Python.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Come Junior year I ended up becoming Vice-President of coding club and continued on my Python journey. This is also where I learned about OOP and how I could have saved literal hours of my time if I just created objects instead of copying and pasting variables 20 million times to slightly tweak them for the next pokemon.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Senior year I did not join the coding club again however I did start getting into a lot of Python frameworks/libraries such as BS4, Selenium, Pygame, and a couple of others. Another thing that I got really familiar with was Discord.py which is a Discord api for creating discord bots that perform functions for servers. 
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                My Freelancing Journey
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                I was able to quickly see how useful web scraping with BS4 was and how it can easily be utilized with Discord bots in order to make useful commands. Because of this, I decided to try out my hand in freelancing and joined servers offering my services to create bots specifically tailored to individual servers.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Although I did not make a ton of money, I did get a lot of offers and a lot of practice and was able to improve my ability to read and store data in files, properly use OOP, and what I think was most useful: scrape the data that is actually useful/wanted inside of a website.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                My freelancing journey ended about a year or so after it started because I was a freshman in college and really wanted to focus on my studies.
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                College
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                College was and still is an experience for me. In my Freshman year, I didn’t learn much more than I already knew. Most classes were coded in C++ which was a new language for me, but aside from syntax differences, everything transferred over from python pretty seamlessly. It was then also that I noticed that once you are pretty solid at one language, it is pretty easy to learn another.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Junior year (Now) I’ve started to learn a lot more about more complex programming fundamentals such as Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, and Hash’s. I’m really looking to find out how I can implement these structures in order to improve all my projects going forward.
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                Personal Projects
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Again, all of my classes thus far in college were programmed almost exclusively in C++. Which was fine, however, my love for python is and always will still be there. As a result, I decided to get into personal projects in order to not get out of practice with it. In doing so I’ve become familiar with even more python libraries such as Tensorflow and MyPlotLib. In addition to that, I got back into JavaScript in order to work on my personal website.
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                Conclusion
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                All in all, I look forward to what’s to come in my future in regard to programming. Hopefully, I will lead to more learning experiences for me, providing me with the challenge I so often seek.
