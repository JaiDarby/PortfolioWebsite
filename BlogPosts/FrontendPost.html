                Frontend and I, how do I say this? We are like the type of friends that started off as mortal enemies sworn to hate each other for eternity. It is not like I didn’t like the idea of Frontend programming at the time, more so that I am not exactly what you call creative. My lack of creativity -visually- was the reason I went into the STEM field in the first place, where I felt like my weakness would not set me back too much, and then in walks Frontend.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                I have not taken a Frontend class nor have I been taught by anyone directly in the subject. But I knew that I wanted to create a portfolio website at some point, and I also knew that I wanted to try my hand at the Backend of websites and the easiest way to do so was to create my own Frontend. So I started my frontend journey.
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                HTML
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                I started learning Junior year the way any web developer should, with learning HTML. HTML was surprisingly easy and through multiple videos and a lot of practice, I was able to pretty easily pick it up. 
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                That said, it should go without saying that after I was satisfied with my ability to structure the pages properly I was hit with the reality that my practice pages looked terrible without and formatting and styling.
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                CSS
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Given what I felt was the necessary next step of learning how to style a web page I then went into learning CSS. Learning CSS was a mess given my lack of creativity. And I found myself wondering why my web pages would not look as good as others. So after I solidified my fundamentals of CSS I started to take a different approach, attempting to recreate already made web pages.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                This idea is probably what saved me from quitting frontend altogether, It helped me realize that I was good at CSS, just very bad at web design which isn’t exactly a bad thing. Given that clients often times will give you an idea of what you want and that you will be working with designers on a team as well most of the time, it is not necessary to be able to think of designs on the spot. Rather than given ideas you are able to create a said design. 
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Also after getting pretty solid with the fundamentals of CSS I decided to look into some CSS frameworks to see if it would make designing from scratch any easier. This is when I was introduced to bootstrap and my world was changed for the better. For more complex stuff Bootstrap does cause a lot of hurdles but when it comes to creating a simple webpage to suit a purpose, it seems like the framework is heaven-sent. 
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                JavaScript
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Of course, when you’re thinking about becoming a web dev the next step after CSS is Javascript so I decided to brush up on my knowledge of the language and how it is used inside the frontend. Needless to say, this came much faster to me than CSS did because most everything that I did in javascript was for the most part having to do with functionality versus design which I am better at.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                I have now started learning React and intend on continuing to do so to be the most efficient programmer I can be.
