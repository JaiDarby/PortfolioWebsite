                Family
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                As many of you know at the very least, my name is Jai’Mir Darby. I was born May, 8th 2021 in Homestead, FL. That is a fairly small suburb about an hour south of Miami. I was born and raised there by my mother and father alongside my 4 brothers. Needless to say, our family wasn’t very lacking in size, but I wouldn’t give it up for the world because their support and love are unquestionable in regard to them.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Growing up as an African American male, nothing much was expected from me outside of my family expectations. Despite this, my mother and father never let me forget how much potential I had and that they wouldn’t let me waste it due to other people’s expectations who didn’t expect me to succeed.
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                Education (K-12)
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                My mother was a teacher so it should go without saying that education has always been a priority since birth. I started schooling in Pre-K 3 and knew a lot such as how to write my name and basic arithmetic by the time I was I entered Kindergarten. 
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Once in Kindergarten, I was placed in the gifted program where I stayed all the way through high school graduation. In 3rd grade, I got a perfect score on my math FACT (Florida Standardized Test) and was given a medal of distinction from my school given to only one other kid in my school.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                At this point in my life, things just came easy to me, oftentimes I would have to be explained something once and that was enough for me to know how to do it, and given a couple of problems I’d be able to explain it just as well as the teacher. 
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                This stood true through even high school where I made the Top 25 in my graduating class of 2019 with a 4.9 GPA. Of the 7 colleges, I applied for (UM, FSU, USF, UCF, UF, FIU, and FAMU) I got accepted into all 7. However, the choice of college for me was decided the moment I got the acceptance letter, I was going to Florida State University to pursue my B.S. degree in Computer Science.
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                College
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Making it into Florida State was a dream come true but the reality of stepping foot on campus for the first was not as much. The campus is great, and it was everything I expected but the culture shock as an African American in a predominantly white institution was finally starting to set in.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Previously living in Miami-Dade county I was very much used to a diverse atmosphere. But this was not at all the case here, and it became very clear very fast to me the reality of what that situation meant. Often times I would be asked the same questions by multiple people along the lines of the following: What sport do you play? Does your brother play sports here? Do you know what affirmative action is? And questions of the sort. 
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Needless to say, these questions are very much telling of people’s assumptions about me being a black kid at the university, but rather than use it as a crutch, I decided to use it as motivation. See my whole life I’ve had assumptions be made about me and I learned at the end of the day there is nothing you can do about stopping people from making assumptions. But something you can do is prove those assumptions wrong, and that’s what I’ve been striving my hardest to do ever since I got to FSU.
              </p>

                Conclusion
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                In conclusion, I am no stranger to having to be the adversary, jumping hurdles to even be put in the game. But once I make it there, I’m going to do everything I can to prove to everyone watching and depending on me that I belong there.
