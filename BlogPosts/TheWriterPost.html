                Needless to say when you think Computer Science major the first thought that comes into your head isn’t exactly “writer”. And for the most part, you would be right, most people who go into the field don’t normally enjoy writing aside from code. I however am different in that sense.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                My mother is an English teacher so from a very young age, I was taught how to speak properly, write my name, know my alphabet, and everything else. I think this training stuck with me as time grew and I developed a passion for utilizing English as an outlet. This can be seen in a lot of my works, whether it be discussions of me debating back and forth, writing papers defending my point on a particular issue, or even writing poetry. Writing has served me well over the years and aside from programming, it is one of the only other things that I have become very good at.

                Just Become A Writer
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Given my passion for it, I’m sure you’re wondering why I didn’t pursue a career as a writer. And you wouldn’t be wrong to ask that. But the answer to me was pretty simple, writing as a career is not sustainable for a majority of people. Or in other words, I need to be able to pay my bills.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Sure, I could easily have become a writer for a newspaper article, academics department, or something of the sort. But the writing of the sort never interested me. I wanted to write about whatever I felt like writing about at the time, I wanted to be an actual author. And that ladies and gentlemen, it is not the easiest task in the world. Spending hours on end writing thousands of words a day, meeting publisher deadlines is draining and can lead to burnout very fast. And with burnout comes the loss of passion, and when you lose your passion for it, then your job just becomes work, something you dread doing. And dreading writing is something that I don’t want to have to experience.
              </p>
              <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                Don't Lose Hope
              </h2>
              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                Given everything mentioned before it might seem that I gave up on the idea of writing altogether but that is not necessarily true. In addition to my CS studies, I am currently writing a Dystopian Novel in my free time that I hope to publish one day. I don’t have a ton of time to work on it but it feels great being able to just go write a couple of pages every now and then whenever I want to. And that has always been the biggest thing with writing for me. The ability to write what I want when I want.
